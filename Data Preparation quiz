                                                                                                                                    1 / 1 point
replace missing values with outliers.


**replace missing values with something reasonable.**


merge samples with missing values.


drop samples with missing values.

3.
Question 3
A data sample with values that are considerably different than the rest of the other data samples in the dataset is called an/a _____________.

                                                                                                                                     1 / 1 point
Noise


Inconsistent data


**Outlier**


Invalid data

4.
Question 4
Which one of the following examples illustrates the use of domain knowledge to address a data quality issue?

                                                                                                                                     1 / 1 point

**Merge duplicate records while retaining relevant data**


Drop samples with missing values


Simply discard the samples that lie significantly outside the distribution of your data


None of these

Question 5
Which of the following is NOT an example of feature selection?

                                                                                                                                     1 / 1 point

Adding an in-state feature based on an applicant's home state.


Removing a feature with a lot of missing values.


**Replacing a missing value with the variable mean.**


Re-formatting an address field into separate street address, city, state, and zip code fields.

6.
Question 6
Which one of the following is the best feature set for your analysis?

                                                                                                                                     1 / 1 point
Feature set that contains exclusively re-coded features


Feature set with the smallest number of features


Feature set with the largest number of features


**Feature set with the smallest set of features that best capture the characteristics of the data for the intended application**

7.
Question 7
The mean value and the standard deviation of a zero-normalized feature are

                                                                                                                                     1 / 1 point
mean = 1 and standard deviation = 1


mean = 1 and standard deviation = 0


**mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1**


mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0

8.
Question 8
Which of the following is NOT true about PCA?

                                                                                                                                    1 / 1 point
**PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that removes a feature that is very correlated with another feature.**


PC1, the first principal component , captures the largest amount of variance in the data along a single dimension.


PCA stands for principal component analysis


PC1 and PC2, the first and second principal components, respectively, are always orthogonal to each other.
