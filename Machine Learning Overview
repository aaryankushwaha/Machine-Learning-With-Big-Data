                                                                                                                      1 / 1 point
**Algorithm Prediction**


Association Analysis


Cluster Analysis


Classification


Regression

Question 4
In unsupervised approaches,

                                                                                                                        1 / 1 point
the target is unlabeled.


**the target is unknown or unavailable.**


the target is what is being predicted.


the target is provided.

Question 5
What is the sequence of the steps in the machine learning process?

                                                                                                                          1 / 1 point
Prepare -> Acquire -> Analyze -> Report -> Act


**Acquire -> Prepare -> Analyze -> Report -> Act**


Prepare -> Acquire -> Analyze -> Act -> Report


Acquire -> Prepare -> Analyze -> Act -> Report

Question 6
Are the steps in the machine learning process apply-once or iterative? 

                                                                                                                         1 / 1 point
Apply-once


**Iterative**


The first two steps, Acquire and Prepare, are apply-once, and the other steps are iterative.

Question 7
Phase 2 of CRISP-DM is Data Understanding.  In this phase,

                                                                                                                          1 / 1 point
**we acquire as well as explore the data that is related to the problem.**


we define the problem or opportunity to be addressed.


we prepare the data for analysis.

Question 8
What is the main difference between KNIME and Spark MLlib?

                                                                                                                           1 / 1 point
KNIME originated in Germany, while Spark MLlib was created in California, USA.


KNIME requires programming, while Spark MLlib does not.


**KNIME is a graphical user interface-based machine learning tool, while Spark MLlib provides a programming-based distributed platform for scalable machine learning algorithms.**


KNIME requires programming in Java, while Spark MLlib requires programming in Python.
